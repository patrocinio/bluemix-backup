The Compose DBaaS is an IBM company. It is not directly associated with Cloud Foundry (the open-source project behind IBM Bluemix). Compose provides *Databases-as-a-Service* (aka: *DBaaS*) for popular open source databases. The service uses a Bluemix Service Broker to bind the Compose service to the [Bluemix Platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/admin/index.html#oc_catalog).
